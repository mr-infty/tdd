1. (p. 233): Listing 8.11 is incorrect. It should read

    exactLengthWith : (len : Nat) -> (input : Vect m a) -> Maybe (Vect len a)
    exactLengthWith {m} len input = case decEq m len of
                                          Yes prf => Just rewrite sym prf in input
                                          No contra => Nothing
