# Chapter 8

1. (p. 233): Listing 8.11 is incorrect. It should read

    exactLengthWith : (len : Nat) -> (input : Vect m a) -> Maybe (Vect len a)
    exactLengthWith {m} len input = case decEq m len of
                                          Yes prf => Just rewrite sym prf in input
                                          No contra => Nothing

# Chapter 9

1. (p. 256): There is no function called `guess`. Does this refer to `processGuess` (or `game`) maybe?

# Chapter 11

1. The definition of `getPrefix` with an explicit `Force` no longer works in Idris 1.3.1; indeed, `xs` is now reported to be of type `InfList typ` instead of `Inf (InfList ty)`.

# Chapter 12

1. The type of `Nat` in listing 12.33 is possibly erroneous; in any case, this listing doesn't type check as there is a mismatch between `Nat` (type of `newDiff`) and `Int` (the type that's in the record declaration).
